# Predictions Changelog

> Important changes to Polymarket prediction markets, including the CLOB, APIs, web application, and mobile applications.

<Update label="Aug 17, 2026" description="Crypto taker delay reduced to 50ms">
  * **Lower taker delay**: The taker delay on crypto markets is now `50ms`, down from `250ms`. The change took effect on **August 17 at 11:00 UTC (7:00 AM ET)**.
</Update>

<Update label="Aug 14, 2026" description="5-minute crypto markets moved to a 60-second Chainlink TWAP">
  * **Longer TWAP window**: All 5-minute crypto markets now resolve using a `60-second` Chainlink TWAP, replacing the `30-second` window introduced on August 7. The change took effect at **00:00 UTC**.
  * **Updated documentation**: See [Chainlink TWAP Prices](/market-data/chainlink-twap).
</Update>

<Update label="Aug 10, 2026" description="Data API: per-outcome redemption activity, position fee basis fields, and event artwork fallback">
  * **Redemptions are now reported per outcome**: on `GET /activity`, a `REDEEM` row carries the outcome it settles in `asset`, `outcome`, and `outcomeIndex`, with `size` as the tokens burned for that outcome and `usdcSize` as that outcome's payout. Redeeming both sides of a market returns **two rows** — one per outcome — where a single combined row appeared before, and the losing outcome's `usdcSize` is `0`. Sum `usdcSize` across a transaction's rows to get the total payout. See [Resolution](/concepts/resolution).
  * **New position basis fields**: `GET /positions` entries can include `grossInitialValue`, the remaining entry basis including attributed buy fees, and `entryFeesUsdc`, that fee component. `initialValue` and `avgPrice` keep their existing fee-exclusive meaning, so the fee-exclusive basis is `grossInitialValue - entryFeesUsdc`. Both fields are optional — treat an omitted field as unavailable, not as zero. See [Positions and Tokens](/concepts/positions-tokens).
  * **New `includeArchived` filter**: `GET /positions` accepts `includeArchived` to return positions in archived markets that are still active. Archived positions remain excluded by default, so existing clients are unaffected.
  * **Event artwork fallback**: `icon` on `GET /activity` and `GET /trades` now falls back to the market image, then the parent event's icon and image, when a market has no icon of its own. Previously these rows returned an empty `icon`.
</Update>

<Update label="Aug 7, 2026" description="Chainlink TWAP resolution for crypto up/down markets">
  * **TWAP-based resolution**: Crypto up/down markets now resolve using Chainlink-computed time-weighted average prices instead of a single price snapshot.
  * **Opening and settlement prices**: Both the price to beat and the final settlement price come from the applicable TWAP feed.
  * **Averaging windows**: 5-minute markets use a `30-second` lookback; 15-minute and 4-hour markets use a `60-second` lookback.
  * **Developer access**: See [Chainlink TWAP Prices](/market-data/chainlink-twap) for RTDS topics, SDK examples, and direct Chainlink Data Streams access.
</Update>

<Update label="Jul 17, 2026" description="Latency improvements and order response changes — Friday July 24, 04:00 UTC">
  * **Rollout Friday, July 24 at 04:00 UTC**: An async commit pipeline cuts matching latency. `POST /order` and `POST /orders` will no longer return `transactionHashes` on successful FAK/FOK matches — you get `tradeIDs` instead. `tradeIDs` behavior is unchanged; websocket fills are unaffected.
  * **SDK users**: Bump to the latest CLOB client (TypeScript, Python, Rust) before rollout — it resolves hashes from `tradeIDs` for you.
  * **Custom REST integrations**: If you depend on inline `transactionHashes`, poll trades by `tradeID` until each has a hash or returns `FAILED`. See [TypeScript](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client-v2/pull/89), [Python](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client-v2/pull/101), and [Rust](https://github.com/Polymarket/rs-clob-client-v2/pull/83).
</Update>

<Update label="Jul 14, 2026" description="Relayer: deprecating CLOB v1 Neg Risk Adapter">
  * **Old adapter retired**: Relayer calls to the CLOB v1 Neg Risk Adapter (`0xd91E80cF2E7be2e162c6513ceD06f1dD0dA35296`) are being deprecated. CLOB v2 integrations should use the current Neg Risk Adapter at `0xadA2005600Dec949baf300f4C6120000bDB6eAab` for all pUSD-collateral actions.
  * **Grace period for redeems**: Relayer redeems targeting the old adapter remain available until **Friday, July 17, 2026 at 00:00 UTC**. After that, relayer calls to the old address are fully retired.
  * **Updated documentation**: See [Contracts](/resources/contracts).
</Update>

<Update label="Jul 10, 2026" description="Sports taker fee and maker rebate update">
  * **Sports fee coefficient**: The sports taker fee rate increases from `0.03` to `0.05` at midnight UTC.
  * **Sports maker rebate**: The sports maker rebate decreases from 25% to 15% of collected taker fees.
  * **Updated documentation**: [Fees](/trading/fees) and [Maker Rebates Program](/programs/maker-rebates).
</Update>

<Update label="Jul 2, 2026" description="World Cup markets decimalized to a 0.0025 (0.25¢) tick size">
  * **Finer tick size for World Cup markets**: All World Cup *to advance*, *moneyline*, *spreads*, and *totals* markets are now decimalized to a **0.0025 (0.25¢)** tick size. This lets you execute at smaller ticks and tighter spreads for the most competitive prices. Applies only to those World Cup markets — see [Place Orders](/trading/place-orders).
</Update>

<Update label="Jun 25, 2026" description="Bridge API: optional X-Builder-Code header">
  * **New optional header**: `POST /deposit` and `POST /withdraw` now accept an `X-Builder-Code` header (bytes32 hex) for builder attribution. Without it, requests still succeed but return a `missing_builder_code` warning; a malformed code returns `400`. See [Deposit](/trading/bridge/deposit) and [Withdraw](/trading/bridge/withdraw).
</Update>

<Update label="Jun 15, 2026" description="CLOB DELETE /orders maximum batch size reduced to 1000">
  * **`DELETE /orders` limit**: The maximum number of order IDs per cancel request is now `1000`. Split larger cancellation batches across multiple requests.
</Update>

<Update label="Jun 1, 2026" description="Increased CLOB order rate limits">
  Raised burst and sustained rate limits for several CLOB trading endpoints.

  * CLOB POST /order - 120000 every 10 minutes (200/s) - (SUSTAINED)
  * CLOB DELETE /order - 120000 every 10 minutes (200/s) - (SUSTAINED)
  * CLOB POST /orders - 2000 every 10s (200/s) - (BURST)
  * CLOB DELETE /orders - 2000 every 10s (200/s) - (BURST)

  See [Rate Limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) for the full table.
</Update>

<Update label="May 18, 2026" description="Data API: builderCode added to /v1/builders/leaderboard and /v1/builders/volume">
  * **New field**: Both `GET /v1/builders/leaderboard` and `GET /v1/builders/volume` now include a `builderCode` string on each entry — the builder's onchain attribution code as attached to orders via `builderCode` (see [Migrating to CLOB V2](/v2-migration)).
  * **Additive change**: existing clients are unaffected. Legacy builders without a registered code return an empty string.
</Update>

<Update label="May 14, 2026" description="GET /markets/keyset maximum limit reduced to 100">
  * **`GET /markets/keyset` limit**: The maximum `limit` value is now `100`. Requests should use `after_cursor`/`next_cursor` to paginate through larger result sets.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 28, 2026" description="CLOB V2 is live on production">
  Polymarket's CLOB V2 upgrade is live on `https://clob.polymarket.com`.

  * **Production URL unchanged**: V2 now runs on the standard CLOB host. New integrations should use `https://clob.polymarket.com`.
  * **No V1 compatibility**: Legacy V1 SDKs and V1-signed orders are no longer supported on production.
  * **Open orders wiped**: Resting orders from before the cutover did not migrate and must be re-created with V2 signing.
  * **Migration guide**: See [Migrating to CLOB V2](/v2-migration) for the SDK, raw order signing, pUSD, and builder attribution changes.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 21, 2026" description="Relayer API: POST /submit returns immediately without transactionHash">
  * **Faster `POST /submit` responses**: The Relayer's `POST /submit` endpoint now returns immediately with just `{ transactionID, state: "STATE_NEW" }`. The `transactionHash` field has been removed from the submit response to improve performance.
  * **How to get the hash**: Poll [`GET /transaction`](/api-reference/relayer/get-a-transaction-by-id) with the returned `transactionID` to retrieve the onchain `transactionHash` once the transaction has been broadcast.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 17, 2026" description="CLOB V2: upgrades go live April 28 at ~11:00 UTC, with ~1 hour of downtime">
  Polymarket is shipping a coordinated upgrade: **new Exchange contracts, a rewritten CLOB backend, and a new collateral token (pUSD)**.

  **Exchange upgrades go live April 28, 2026 at \~11:00 UTC with \~1 hour of downtime.** All integrations must migrate to the V2 SDK before the cutover — there will be no backward compatibility after go-live.

  **Full walkthrough:** [Migrating to CLOB V2](/v2-migration). Follow [Discord](https://discord.gg/polymarket), Telegram, and [status.polymarket.com](https://status.polymarket.com) for the exact start time.

  **Historical pre-cutover note:** before go-live, integrations could test against `https://clob-v2.polymarket.com`. As of April 28, V2 runs on `https://clob.polymarket.com`.

  **What's changing**

  * New Exchange contracts (CTF Exchange V2 + Neg Risk CTF Exchange V2)
  * **pUSD** replaces USDC.e as the collateral token (standard ERC-20 on Polygon, backed by USDC, backing enforced onchain)
  * Order struct: `nonce`, `feeRateBps`, `taker` removed — `timestamp` (ms), `metadata`, `builder` added
  * Fees are now set at match time — no more `feeRateBps` on orders
  * Builder attribution is native via `builderCode` on orders (no more `builder-signing-sdk`)
  * EIP-712 Exchange domain version bumps from `"1"` to `"2"` (ClobAuth stays at `"1"`)

  **What you need to do**

  * Install the V2 SDK — [`@polymarket/clob-client-v2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polymarket/clob-client-v2) or [`py-clob-client-v2`](https://pypi.org/project/py-clob-client-v2/) — and remove the legacy `clob-client` / `py-clob-client` packages
  * Update constructor from positional args to options object; rename `chainId` → `chain`
  * Remove `feeRateBps`, `nonce`, and `taker` from your order creation code
  * If you're a builder, copy your code from [Settings → Builder](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder) and attach it to orders
  * If you sign orders without the SDK, update the `verifyingContract` and the signed Order fields — see [For API users](/v2-migration#for-api-users)
  * Plan for all open orders to be wiped at cutover

  **During the window:** Trading will be paused for \~1 hour on April 28 starting around 11:00 UTC. The SDK's hot-swap mechanism will auto-refresh the client when V2 goes live — no manual action needed if you're on the latest SDK.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 13, 2026" description="Bridge API: added support link for bridging issues">
  * **Support contact**: Added a link to [our Bridge API provider's support](https://intercom.help/funxyz/en/articles/10732578-contact-us) (Fun.xyz) for failed, stuck, or compliance-held bridge transactions. See [Deposit Status](/trading/bridge/status).
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 10, 2026" description="New keyset pagination endpoints for markets and events">
  * **New endpoints**: Added `GET /markets/keyset` and `GET /events/keyset` for cursor-based pagination, replacing offset-based `GET /markets` and `GET /events`.
  * **How it works**: These use an opaque `after_cursor`/`next_cursor` token instead of `offset`, providing stable and efficient paging through large result sets. Same filters, same response shape per item — the only differences are the wrapper response (`{ "markets": [...], "next_cursor": "..." }`) and the rejection of `offset`.
  * **Migration**: The existing `GET /markets` and `GET /events` endpoints remain available but will be deprecated in a future release. New integrations should use the keyset variants.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 9, 2026" description="GET /markets: closed defaults to false">
  * **`closed` default change**: The `closed` query parameter on `GET /markets` now defaults to `false`. Closed markets are excluded from results unless you explicitly pass `closed=true`.
</Update>

<Update label="April 8, 2026" description="Increased API Rate Limits">
  Increased burst and sustained rate limits for several CLOB trading endpoints.

  * CLOB POST /order - 5000 every 10s (500/s) - (BURST)
  * CLOB POST /order - 48000 every 10 minutes (80/s)
  * CLOB DELETE /order - 5000 every 10s (500/s) - (BURST)
  * CLOB DELETE /order - 48000 every 10 minutes (80/s)
  * CLOB POST /orders - 1500 every 10s (150/s) - (BURST)
  * CLOB POST /orders - 21000 every 10 minutes (35/s)
  * CLOB DELETE /cancel-market-orders - 1500 every 10s (150/s) - (BURST)
  * CLOB DELETE /cancel-market-orders - 21000 every 10 minutes (35/s)

  * **Updated documentation**: [Trading Fees](/trading/fees) and [Maker Rebates Program](/programs/maker-rebates).
</Update>

<Update label="Mar 17, 2026" description="March Madness: $2M+ in Liquidity Rewards">
  * **March Madness Liquidity Rewards**: Adding \$2M+ in liquidity rewards to both live and pregame markets.
  * **How it works**: Liquidity rewards are payments for placing competitive bids. Rewards are paid out based on the size of your orders, how close they are to the midpoint, and how consistently they are quoted relative to other liquidity providers.

</Update>

<Update label="July 23, 2025" description="Get Book(s) update">
  * We’re adding new fields to the `get-book` and `get-books` CLOB endpoints to include key market metadata that previously required separate queries.
    * `min_order_size`
      * type: string
      * description: Minimum price increment.
    * `neg_risk`
      * type: boolean
      * description: Boolean indicating whether the market is neg\_risk.
    * `tick_size`
      * type: string
      * description: Minimum price increment.
</Update>

<Update label="June 3, 2025" description="New Batch Orders Endpoint">
  * We’re excited to roll out a highly requested feature: **order batching**. With this new endpoint, users can now submit up to five trades in a single request.

</Update>

<Update label="June 3, 2025" description="Change to /data/trades">
  * We're adding a new `side` field to the `MakerOrder` portion of the trade object. This field will indicate whether the maker order is a `buy` or `sell`, helping to clarify trade events where the maker side was previously ambiguous. For more details, refer to the MakerOrder object on the [Manage Orders](/trading/manage-orders) page.

</Update>

<Update label="May 28, 2025" description="New FAK Order Type">
  We’re excited to introduce a new order type soon to be available to all users: Fill and Kill (FAK). FAK orders behave similarly to the well-known Fill or Kill (FOK) orders, but with a key difference:

  * FAK will fill as many shares as possible immediately at your specified price, and any remaining unfilled portion will be canceled.
  * Unlike FOK, which requires the entire order to fill instantly or be canceled, FAK is more flexible and aims to capture partial fills if possible.
</Update>

<Update label="May 15, 2025" description="Increased API Rate Limits">
  All API users will enjoy increased rate limits for the CLOB endpoints.

  * CLOB - /books (website) (300req - 10s / Throttle requests over the maximum configured rate)
