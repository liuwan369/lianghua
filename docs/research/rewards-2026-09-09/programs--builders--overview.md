# Overview

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Places Order">
    User places an order through your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach Builder Code">
    Your app adds your builder code to each order.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit to CLOB">
    Order is submitted to Polymarket's CLOB — the builder code is serialized
    onchain as part of the signed order.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trade Execution">
    Polymarket matches the order and covers gas fees for onchain operations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Volume Attribution">
    Volume is credited to your builder account for every matched trade where
    your code is attached.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Started

  <Step title="Create Builder Profile">
    Open polymarket.com → Settings →
    [Builders](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder) and copy your builder
    code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach Your Builder Code">
    Attach your builder code to every order you submit. See [Builder
    Attribution](/trading/place-orders#builder-attribution).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Gasless Transactions">
    Use the Polymarket relayer to deploy wallets and [execute gasless
    transactions](/trading/wallets-auth#execute-gasless-transactions).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Performance">
    Monitor your volume on the [Builder
    Leaderboard](https://builders.polymarket.com).

    Allow up to **24 hours** for matched volume to appear on the leaderboard.
