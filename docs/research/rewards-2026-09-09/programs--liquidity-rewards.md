# Liquidity Rewards

> Earn rewards for providing liquidity on Polymarket

By posting resting limit orders, liquidity providers (makers) are automatically eligible for Polymarket's incentive program. Rewards are distributed directly to maker addresses daily at midnight UTC.

The program is designed to:

* Catalyze liquidity across all markets
* Encourage liquidity throughout a market's entire lifecycle
* Motivate passive, balanced quoting tight to a market's midpoint
* Encourage trading activity
* Discourage blatantly exploitative behaviors

<Note>
  The minimum reward payout is **\$1**; amounts below this will not be paid.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Each incentivized market defines a minimum qualifying order size, maximum
  qualifying spread, and reward allocation. See [Liquidity Reward
  Settings](/market-data/market-details#liquidity-reward-settings) to read the
  current configuration for a market.
</Tip>

## Crypto TWAP Rewards

To support liquidity through this transition, Polymarket is adding **\$1M** in
liquidity rewards across impacted markets through the month of August. This
allocation applies only to crypto **5-minute**, **15-minute**, and **4-hour**
markets that settle on TWAP.

<Note>
  The pools below are configured reward caps. Actual payouts depend on eligible
  quoting and the scoring methodology on this page.

## Methodology

Liquidity providers are rewarded based on a formula that rewards participation in markets, boosts two-sided depth (single-sided orders still score), and tighter spread vs the size-cutoff-adjusted midpoint. Each market configures a max spread and min size cutoff within which orders are considered. The average of rewards earned is determined by the relative share of each participant's Q<sub>n</sub> in market m.

## Equations

### 1. Order Scoring Function

Quadratic scoring rule for an order based on position between the adjusted midpoint and the minimum qualifying spread:

$S(v,s)= (\frac{v-s}{v})^2 \cdot b$

### 2. First Market Side Score

$Q_{one}= S(v,Spread_{m_1}) \cdot BidSize_{m_1} + S(v,Spread_{m_2}) \cdot BidSize_{m_2} + \dots $
$ + S(v, Spread_{m^\prime_1}) \cdot AskSize_{m^\prime_1} + S(v, Spread_{m^\prime_2}) \cdot AskSize_{m^\prime_2}$

### 3. Second Market Side Score

$Q_{two}= S(v,Spread_{m_1}) \cdot AskSize_{m_1} + S(v,Spread_{m_2}) \cdot AskSize_{m_2} + \dots $
$ + S(v, Spread_{m^\prime_1}) \cdot BidSize_{m^\prime_1} + S(v, Spread_{m^\prime_2}) \cdot BidSize_{m^\prime_2}$

### 4. Minimum Score

Boosts two-sided liquidity by taking the minimum of Q<sub>ne</sub> and Q<sub>no</sub>, while still rewarding single-sided liquidity at a reduced rate (divided by c).

**If midpoint is in range \[0.10, 0.90]** — single-sided liquidity can score:

$Q_{\min} = \max(\min({Q_{one}, Q_{two}}), \max(Q_{one}/c, Q_{two}/c))$

**If midpoint is in range \[0, 0.10) or (0.90, 1.0]** — liquidity must be double-sided to score:

$Q_{\min} = \min({Q_{one}, Q_{two}})$

### 5. Normalized Score

Q<sub>min</sub> of a market maker divided by the sum of all Q<sub>min</sub> across market makers in a given sample:

$Q_{normal} = \frac{Q_{min}}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}{(Q_{min})_n}}$

### 6. Epoch Score

Sum of all Q<sub>normal</sub> for a trader across all samples in an epoch:

$Q_{epoch} = \sum_{u=1}^{10,080}{(Q_{normal})_u}$

### 7. Final Score

Normalizes Q<sub>epoch</sub> by dividing by the sum of all market makers' Q<sub>epoch</sub> in a given epoch. This value is multiplied by the rewards available for the market to get a trader's reward:

$Q_{final}=\frac{Q_{epoch}}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}{(Q_{epoch})_n}}$

***

## Worked Example

Assume an adjusted market midpoint of 0.50 and a max spread config of 3 cents for both m and m'.

### Step 2 - First Side Score

A trader has the following open orders:

* 100Q bid on m @ 0.49 (spread = 1 cent)
* 200Q bid on m @ 0.48 (spread = 2 cents)
* 100Q ask on m' @ 0.51 (spread = 1 cent)

$$
Q_{ne} = \left( \frac{(3-1)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100 + \left( \frac{(3-2)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 200 + \left( \frac{(3-1)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100
$$

Q<sub>ne</sub> is calculated every minute using random sampling.

### Step 3 - Second Side Score

The same trader also has:

* 100Q bid on m @ 0.485 (spread = 1.5 cents)
* 100Q bid on m' @ 0.48 (spread = 2 cents)
* 200Q ask on m' @ 0.505 (spread = 0.5 cents)

$$
Q_{no} = \left( \frac{(3-1.5)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100 + \left( \frac{(3-2)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100 + \left( \frac{(3-.5)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 200
$$

Q<sub>no</sub> is calculated every minute using random sampling.

### Steps 4-7

4. Take the minimum of Q<sub>ne</sub> and Q<sub>no</sub> (with single-sided adjustment if midpoint is in \[0.10, 0.90])
5. Normalize against all other market makers in the sample
6. Sum across all 10,080 samples in the epoch
7. Normalize again to get final reward share
